The goal of this assignment is to complete a “file system dump” operation of a simple file system, which is inspired
by some UNIX-like file systems (MinixFS and UFS). The Basic File System (BFS) does not use the full features of 
the abovementioned FSs, like subdirectories or permission checking. However, space is reserved for a single, 
fixed-size, directory.
